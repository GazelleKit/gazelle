<h1>Calcpad</h1>

<p align="justify">
  Structural Engineers accept enormous responsibility when they opt to dedicate their lives to improve our built environment. However, the digital tools currently at their disposal are often closed-source and proprietary. Engineers have very little opportunity to inspect, or influence, the algorithms behind the software used to analyse and design our buildings and bridges. This must change.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Structural Engineers must have access to tools and technologies that are open, transparent and verifiable. Calculations and design procedures should be implemented in such a way that Engineers can (1) adopt them with confidence, (2) inspect them, and (3) propose amendments, corrections and enhancements.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  This library aspires to become the de facto implementation for Structural Engineering design worldwide. Through global contribution and collaboration, we are assembling a comprehensive repository of international design code implementations (e.g., Eurocode, ACI, etc.), atop a core layer of structural mechanics algorithms.
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Together, we're building a profession that is open-minded, open-hearted, and open-source.
