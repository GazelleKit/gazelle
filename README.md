## Why?

Engineers accept phenomenal responsibility when dedicating their lives to improve our built environment. Nevertheless, the vast majority of professional engineering software is closed source and proprietary. Engineers can rarely inspect, validate or influence the algorithms used to design our buildings and bridges. We believe this is unfair and must change. Fortress aspires to become the _single source of truth_ for Civil & Structural Engineering Design algorithms. 

## Our Mission

Re-inventing the wheel is costly and introduces risk of error. Fortress provides your AEC development teams with battle-tested, reliable and community-driven design algorithms to supercharge your workflows! You can focus on developing the features that matter to you and your teams: those that drive competitive business value. Fortress is the foundation underpinning a developer-friendly API infrastructure for Civil & Structural Engineers that integrates seamlessly across all modern technology stacks and emphasises:

1. Transparency, 
2. Robustness, 
3. Simplicity.

## How?

## Values

We aspire to foster a community of contributors who believe that: 

1. Engineers should be able to rely on the same tried-and-tested algorithms across all modern tech stacks.
2. Re-inventing the wheel is unnecessary and introduces risk of bugs in calculations.
3. Through collaboration, we can be more effective as an industry.

## Sponsors

We welcome all financial contributions that can: 

1. Help us to keep the vision alive, 
2. Empower us to build more great features,
3. Support our open-source server costs.
