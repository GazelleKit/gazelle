## Why?

Engineers accept phenomenal responsibility when dedicating their lives to improve our built environment. Nevertheless, the vast majority of professional engineering software is closed source and proprietary. Engineers can rarely inspect, validate or influence the algorithms used to design our buildings and bridges. We believe this is unfair and must change.

## Our Mission

As a community, we're building a library for Structural Engineers that emphasises:

1. Transparency, 
2. Robustness, 
3. Portability.

## How?

## Values

We aspire to foster a community of contributors who believe that: 

1. Through collaboration, we can be more effective as an industry, 
2. Re-inventing the wheel is unnecessary and introduces risk of bugs in calculations,
3. Engineers should be able to adopt these algorithms across a variety of technology stacks.

## Sponsors

We welcome all financial contributions that can help to: 

1. Keep the vision alive, 
2. Contribute towards our admin and server costs.

## License

We value the efforts of our community in helping us to develop the most comprehensive library available for Structural Engineers. Open Source Software (OSS) survives on a trust-based relationship; accordingly, we have adopted a strict _copyleft_ license (AGPLv3).
