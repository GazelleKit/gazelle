## Why?

Engineers accept phenomenal responsibility when dedicating their lives to improve our built environment. Nevertheless, the vast majority of professional engineering software is closed source and proprietary. Engineers can rarely inspect, validate or influence the algorithms used to design our buildings and bridges. We believe this is unfair and must change.

## Our Mission

Fortress is the foundation underpinning an intuitive API-as-a-Service infrastructure for Civil & Structural Engineers that emphasises:

1. Transparency, 
2. Robustness, 
3. Portability.

## How?

## Values

We aspire to foster a community of contributors who believe that: 

1. Engineers should be able to rely on the same tried-and-tested algorithms across all modern tech stacks.
2. Re-inventing the wheel is unnecessary and introduces risk of bugs in calculations.
3. Through collaboration, we can be more effective as an industry.

## Sponsors

We welcome all financial contributions that can: 

1. Help us to keep the vision alive, 
2. Empower us to build more great features,
3. Support our open-source server costs.
