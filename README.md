## Overview

Gazelle is a fast, efficient and lightweight toolkit for Structural Engineers. It favours radical simplicity and loosely follows the Unix Philosophy. Gazelle offers a truly cross-platform alternative to traditional engineering software.

## Open Source

Engineers accept phenomenal responsibility when dedicating their lives to improve our built environment. However, the vast majority of professional engineering software is, regrettably, closed source and proprietary. This is unfair and must change. Engineers should be offered the respect and freedom to inspect, validate and influence the algorithms used to design our buildings and bridges. 

Gazelle is proudly open-source.

## Contributing

For those interested in helping to build Gazelle, details will be provided in due course. Please ‚≠êÔ∏è and 'watch' this repository, so that you can track its progress in real-time.

## Errata

Gazelle aspires to achieve the highest standards of professional rigour. We consider Structural Analysis & Design software to be _safety critical_. We strive to ensure stability, robustness and correctness throughout the source code, test suite and companion documentation. Nevertheless, our team are human and mistakes _are_ possible. 

We recommend that all users carefully review the code, tests and documentation. Please submit error reports and suggestions for improvement via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/calcpadstudio/gazelle/issues). For anyone who would like to attempt a fix or improvement, we would encourage you to review our [Contributing](#contributing) guidance and submit a Pull Request.
