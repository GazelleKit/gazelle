## Our Mission

<p align="justify">
  At calcpad, we're building <em>truly</em> open software that is transparent, ethical and robust.
</p>

## Why?

<p align="justify">
  Engineers accept phenomenal responsibility when dedicating their lives to improve our built environment. Nevertheless, the vast majority of professional engineering software is closed source and proprietary. Engineers can rarely inspect, validate or influence the algorithms used to design our buildings and bridges. We believe this is unfair and must change.
</p>

## License

We value the efforts of our community in helping to make calcpad the best suite of open source engineering software available. Accordingly, we have adopted a strict <em>copyleft</em> license (AGPLv3) to encourage voluntary contribution without fear of proprietary theft. Open Source Software (OSS) survives on a trust-based relationship; we believe our choice of license helps to frame the kind of community we're aspiring to build.
