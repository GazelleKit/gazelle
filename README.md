## Our Mission

As a community, we're building <em>truly</em> open software that is transparent, ethical and robust.

## Why?

Engineers accept phenomenal responsibility when dedicating their lives to improve our built environment. Nevertheless, the vast majority of professional engineering software is closed source and proprietary. Engineers can rarely inspect, validate or influence the algorithms used to design our buildings and bridges. We believe this is unfair and must change.

## License

We value the efforts of our community in helping us to develop the best suite of engineering software available. Open Source Software (OSS) survives on a trust-based relationship; accordingly, we have adopted a strict _copyleft_ license (AGPLv3).
