# Structures ðŸŽ—

## Purpose

Structural Engineers take on extraordinary levels of responsibility when they choose to design our built environment. However, many of the tools at their disposal are closed-source and fully-proprietary. Engineers have very little, if any, opportunity to inspect the algorithms used to analyse and design the structural components within their buildings and bridges. Structural Engineering is a well-established profession that is, quite rightly, closely scrutinised for best-practice and ethical correctness. It is unfair that Structural Engineers should be obliged to use tools they cannot personally inspect and verify, should they wish. This project aspires to return some level of autonomy and confidence to the Structural Engineer, so that they may continue to improve our world with a solid understanding of the software at their disposal.

## Aspirations

We can go further when we collaborate across the wider community. Accordingly, this project aspires to: 

1. Bring together the best Structural Engineering minds across industry and academia, and
2. Provide a core library of robust, performant code that implements various international Design Standards.

I hope you'll agree that this effort is both useful and necessary to drive our industry forwards, in an open and verifiable manner.
