description: A fast engine for civil engineering design.

# Foreword

This might just be _the_ most important project that I commit to in my lifetime. 

It is mammoth in terms of both scale and responsibility, and it is technologically complex to execute. I’ve mulled over this project in various guises since I was 22 and a fresh graduate. Since, then I’ve learned a great deal and prototyped multiple iterations to converge on the right solution. 

# What is Gazelle?

A high-performance, memory-safe engine written in Rust that exposes a stable API surface for higher-level language bindings. The goal is to ensure a fast, stable, correct source-of-truth for engineering domain logic upon which Civil Engineers working in scripting languages like Python and JavaScript can build reliable, innovative applications without having to rewrite core design algorithms and potentially introducing bugs. By pooling collective intelligence and open-source community contributions, the goal is to create a trusted engine powering the future of civil and structural design.

 provides a single-source-of-truth for higher-level language API bindings on top, initially in Python, then JavaScript and then whatever catches the imagination. It’s also the right time to start this endeavour again, with a fresh project, given the recent promotion of the Eurocodes Version 2. For now, it’s a passion project - something I believe tremendous engineering value to the community, that helps to mitigate the risk of catastrophic structural collapse when someone implements something incorrectly in a high-level language after having re-written the same algorithm several times in another language, and that is not inherently valuable to any one particular engineering organisation. A bit like how the internet transformed society, I believe Gazelle can transform Civil Engineering. It’s a bold premises, but in all the time I’ve considered the implementation and spoken to countless talented Engineers building cool products, I remain steadfast in my belief that this is a project worth building. It will remain free-to-use forever, it will always be open-source, and it’s the purest form of engineering in that it’s simply man striving to change the world through the invention of new technology. It’s core infrastructure, it’s a public good. It will power the next generation of civil engineering solutions and will run everywhere, including on-device and on IoT. I believe it will be my life’s work and bringing it to fruition will be my proudest personal achievement.

Thank you for your trust.
I'm glad you've joined the herd.
