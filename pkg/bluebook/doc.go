// As Structural Engineers adopt digital workflows, the availability of data
// in consumable formats becomes increasingly important. Structural design data
// is often captured within Excel spreadsheets, books, tables and figures, which
// is inconvenient from a software perspective. Moreover, mapping data from one
// format to another can be time-consuming and a frequent source of error.
// Bluebook encapsulates the Steel for Life steel section data as a library
// with a stable and convenient API.
