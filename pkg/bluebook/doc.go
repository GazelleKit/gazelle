// As Structural Engineers adopt digital workflows, the availability
// of data in consumable formats becomes increasingly important.
// Structural design data is often captured within Excel spreadsheets,
// books, tables and figures, which is inconvenient from a software
// perspective. Moreover, mapping data from one format to another can
// be time-consuming and a frequent source of error. The bluebook
// package encapsulates the Steel for Life steel section data as a
// library with a stable and convenient API. The original .xlsx data
// files were sourced from: https://www.steelforlifebluebook.co.uk.
